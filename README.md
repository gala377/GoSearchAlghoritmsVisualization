# GoSearchAlghoritmsVisualization
Simple visualization of search alghoritms written in OpenGL

Press "s" to start and "r" to generate a new labyrinth. 

Oh... and "w" for wireframe if that's what you like.

# What alghoritms 
For now it's A*, BFS and DFS.

Mind that A* implementation is actually not an A* and it's not working (yeah, sorry).
I'll correct that in the future, I promise.

# How can I check it?

1. Clone repo to your go workspace under `github.com/gala377/SearchAlghorithms`
2. As it's in OpenGL you'll need [this](https://github.com/go-gl). At least gl (v4.3-core), glfw 3.2, and glm. For glm it's possible you'll need [this](https://github.com/golang/image).
3. `go build`
4. Have fun.
